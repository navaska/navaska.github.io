## 3D PRINTER
 **I**n my 3rd day of fablab works i learned more things about the 3D printer .As it is already explained it is CNC machine itself. We can develop any solid structures throygh the 3D printer. All the things we have know that is to create the *3D design* of the structure. For the development 3D structuters we can use any kind of 3D designing softwares.
 
 ### Commonly used Softwares for 3D design are
 1.Rhinoceros
 
 2.Solid works
 
 3.Catia
 
 4.AutoCad
 
 
  After the designing of the 3D structures we have to save the file in **.stl** format. stl means that stereolithography file format used for the 3D structue designing.
        
 3D printer reads only G-codes so that we have to convert the **.stl** format file into **.gcode** format. For the conversion we can use any softwares which converts the files into **.gcode** format. Here our 3D printer is **ULTIMAKER 2+**. it has it's own customized software called **CURA** for the conversion of 3D structures into .gcode format.

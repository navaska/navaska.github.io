## VINYL CUTTER

In the sixth day of fab works  I learned about vinyl cutter and how to operate it.

It is simply like a printer.We can use Cut studio or coral draw for vinyl cutting.

The vinyl cutter uses a small knife to precisely cut the outline of figures into a sheet or piece of vinyl, but not the release liner. The knife moves side to side and turns, while the vinyl is moved beneath the knife. The results from the cut process is an image cut into the material.

## **My vinyl cutting experience**

I have to cut **INNOVATION CENTRE** In vinyl cutting for displaying out of the Innovation centre.For that initially i opened the **CUT STUDIO** software and using TEXT typed **INNOVATION CENTRE** in it.

Then i changed the properties of the text like font size,font type etc... 

Next step is to load the vinyl cutter with vinyl sheet and setting up the vinyl cutter

Select the whole text and using print option print the text.  The viny cutter will perform the function.

After completing the machine process release the vinyl sheet and cut out the required portions.

Make sure the project surface where the text has to apply is clean dry. Carefully place the transfer tape with vinyl images onto the surface

Peel the transfer tape away from the vinyl at a 45-degree angle.
